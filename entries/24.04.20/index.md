I have been following the numerical progression of the Covid-19 pandemic and trying to make myself an idea of the its magnitude.

I have chosen to avoid basing my assesment on chinese statistics, the reason being China's precedents regarding censorship and freedoms, reports of activist journalists being detained and the publication of propaganda.

Italy seems to be a good source of information and in particular Lombardy (Lombardia), the most struck region with a population 10.04 million and, 28760 cases and and 3776 deaths [as of 23/03/2020](http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_pagineAree_5351_30_file.pdf).

In 2018, Lombardy had [99,542 death](https://ugeo.urbistat.com/AdminStat/en/it/demografia/popolazione/lombardia/3/2), which is in line with the average mortality rate in Italy, which has been hovering a hair [above 1% for the last years](https://www.statista.com/statistics/568024/death-rate-in-italy/).

This gives us an average of 8300 persons dying in Lombardy every month, before the Covid pandemic. Add or remove 15% of seasonal fluctuation, it gives us a normal number of monthy deaths between 7000 and 9500, or daily between 233 and 316.

To put this in perspective, the total death attributed to coronavirus in Lombardia during the last 30 days, was 3776.

Yesterday **320** Lombardians died because of Covid 19. Looking at the last 2 weeks or so, the rate of death seem to have stabilized, even possibly gone on a downwards trend (we will know in the coming weeks) which is good.

It is obvious from these numbers that hospitals and personnel there are currently overworked by a significant margin, as reported in interviews by italian health personnel.
