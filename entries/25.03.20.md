[Spain had a relatively low mortality rate](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2019/07/18/inenglish/1563440499_796507.html) of 829 for every 100,000 persons in 2016, before the coronovirus (Covid-19) pandemic. 

This means that the average number of deaths across all of Spain was **1045** per day, of which 62% were attributed to cardiovascular diseases and cancer.
